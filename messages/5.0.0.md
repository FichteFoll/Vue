5.0.0 (2024-11-22)
==================

The "Vue Syntax Highlight" package
- has been adopted by the Sublime Text community,
- is now maintained at https://github.com/SublimeText/Vue, and
- has been renamed to just "Vue".

As a result of the rename, the previous syntax paths have become invalid
and you will need to re-select the "Vue Component" syntax
for each currently open view manually.
Alternatively, you can simply close and reopen each affected file.
